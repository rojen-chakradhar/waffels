            <li>Mixing Bowl</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <h3>ingridents</h3>
            <li>2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cups all-purposr flour (270g)</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup granulated sugar (50g)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups milk (480ml)</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup unsalted butter (melted) (113g)</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <h3>instructions</h3>
            <li>Preheat the waffle iron. (If you can choose settings, I recommend a darker or higher heat setting for a crispier waffle.)</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk together the milk, melted butter, eggs, and vanilla. Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture and stir together just until combined.</li>
            <li>Grease the hot waffle iron with butter or cooking spray. Add about 1/3 cup of batter for each waffle to the hot waffle iron. (The amount will depend on the size of your waffle maker so feel free to experiment with how much you add.)</li>
            <li>Cook until golden brown. Place on a wire rack until ready to serve so they stay crisp. Serve hot with maple syrup and butter or your favorite toppings.</li>
          </ul>
          <ol>
            <h3>notes</h3>
            <li><strong>Use room temperature eggs if possible.</strong> This is not a make-or-break situation! If you are making this waffle recipe first thing in the morning and need to use eggs straight out of the refrigerator, your waffles will still turn out delicious! But if you have the time, set the eggs out 30 minutes to 1 hour before you start the waffles.</li>
            <li><strong>Weigh the flour.</strong> If you don’t feel like whipping out the kitchen scale at breakfast time, you can measure the flour right out of the bag, but give it a light fluff and spoon it into the measuring cup, then level it off with a knife. Never scoop directly into the bag. For this method, use 2 cups of flour. If you do use a kitchen scale, measure 270 grams, which is actually 2¼ cups of flour. I’ve tested this recipe countless times, and both of these methods of measuring flour yield perfect waffles.</li>
            <li><strong>Don’t over-mix the batter.</strong> Once the wet and dry ingredients are just incorporated, the batter is ready. It might be a little lumpy, and that’s okay! Those lumps will actually help with the fluffy texture.</li>
            <li><strong>For waffles that stay crisp:</strong> Place the cooked waffles on a wire rack when they’re ready. If you pile them up on a platter, they release steam and soften up. You can also warm the oven to 200°F and place the wire rack in the oven to keep the waffles warm.</li>
            <li><strong>Between waffles, let the waffle iron heat up again.</strong> A warm waffle maker will not give you crisp waffles: You need it screaming hot, so give it at least 30 seconds between each waffle to heat back up.</li>
